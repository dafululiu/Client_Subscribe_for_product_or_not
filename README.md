# Client_Subscribe_for_product_or_not
A very basic approach for ML Classification.The data provided contains details of direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, multiple contacts were required to be made to the same client to successfully sell the product(bank term deposit). You are required to build a​ binary classification Machine Learning model​ that will predict(yes/no) if a client will subscribe to the product, given his/her demographic and marketing campaign related information.
